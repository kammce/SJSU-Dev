/**
 * @file
 * This contains the period callback functions for the periodic scheduler
 *
 * @warning
 * These callbacks should be used for hard real-time system, and the priority of these
 * tasks are above everything else in the system (above the PRIORITY_CRITICAL).
 * The period functions SHOULD NEVER block and SHOULD NEVER run over their time slot.
 * For example, the 1000Hz take slot runs periodically every 1ms, and whatever you
 * do must be completed within 1ms.  Running over the time slot will reset the system.
