/**
 * @file  i2c_base.hpp
 * @brief Provides I2C Base class functionality for I2C peripherals
 *
 * 20140212 : Improved the driver by not having internal memory to copy the
 *            transaction's data.  The buffer supplied from the user is used directly.
 * 20131211 : Used timeout for read/write semaphore (instead of portMAX_DELAY)
 *              Refactored code, and made the write transfer wait for completion
 *              and return true upon success.

 * I2C Base class that can be used to write drivers for all I2C peripherals.
 *  Steps needed to write a I2C driver:
 *  - Inherit this class
 *  - Call init() and configure PINSEL to select your I2C pins
 *  - When your I2C(#) hardware interrupt occurs, call handleInterrupt()
 *
 *  To connect I2C Interrupt with your I2C, reference this example:
 *  @code
 *  extern "C"
 *   {
 *      void I2C0_IRQHandler()
 *      {
 *          I2C0::getInstance().handleInterrupt();
 *      }
 *   }
 *  @endcode
